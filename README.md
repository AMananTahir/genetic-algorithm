# Multi-variable Polynomial Equation Solver

My University project, Multi-variable polynomial equation solver using genetic algorithm.

Written in Java SE 8 with Swing GUI in Netbeans IDE.

###Features:
- A nice GUI for app and creating polynomial equation.
- Every thing is a parameter and can be changed 
(Such as Population Size, Generations, Crossover and Mutation Probability , Elitisim Ratio, etc)
- Calculating Best and average fitness for each generation.
- Generating full and nice charts and tables for results.

***

- Supporting both tournament and roulette wheel in selection.
- Repetitive Chromosomes can be allowed or not.
- Cross Over can be single point or double point.
- All or some of three above states can be executed for one equation and results can be compared.
